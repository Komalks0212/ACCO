# About ACCO

This is an App based project done by myself and 4 other people. We created an Android App for students in Germany to be able to find accommodation. React Native was used to create the application. In the backend, databases were created using MySQL and PostgreSQL. Javascript and Postman were used to perform CRUD on the databases.
