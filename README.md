# About ACCO

This is an App based project done by myself and other 4 people. We created an Android App for students in Germany to be able to find accommodation. React-Native was used to create the application. In the backend, databases were created using MySQL and PostgreSQL. Python and Postman were used to perform CRUD on the databases.
